# Performance Optimization

Use fewer Join statements and Use indexes if you want to access data from your database really fast even when it is in large data, sequential search is harder and slower when the data is bigger.

## Partitioning

Partition your tables more because it helps to reduce the time it takes to retreive a data, use this with indexes and you reduce quite some time when accessing data in your database
